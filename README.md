# NU Street Navigation 
## Description 
NU Street Navigation is an object-oriented approach to 
finding optimal paths between different points of 
interest on Northwestern University's campus. 

NU Street Navigation first requires an inputted
OpenStreetMap (.osm) file in order to build a 
graph based on the various points of interests
as well as the paths between them. Then, it 
utilizes a variety of pathfinding algorithms
to determine the optimal path between these 
points of interest. 

Finally, it will return an intuitive, accessible
path from one building to another by the
various points of interest on the path.
